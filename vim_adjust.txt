keys used for moving within vim

j,k ==> moving up and down
l,h ==> moving right and left 

number before the j,k,l,h specifies how many lines/words to move
for ex 10j or 10k moves 10 lines up/down and 10l or 10h moves 10 words left/right

A,I ==> moves to the end/start of the line respectively

u ==> for undo the last change made
