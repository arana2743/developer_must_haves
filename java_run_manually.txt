To run java file locally into output folder in terminal

1. To compile .java file into 'out' folder
  javac -d out/ src/<file-name>.java

2. And then run the .class file from 'out' folder
  java -cp out/ <class-name>


And in VSCode with help of code-runner extension you can run .java file with below settings:

"code-runner.runInTerminal":true,
"code-runner.executorMap": {
  "java": "cd $dir && mkdir -p out && javac -d out/ $fileName && java -cp out/ $fileNameWithoutExt",
}
